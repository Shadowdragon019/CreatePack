Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft client, and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting systems on the client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will only remain effective on the client side if the server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of NoChatReports, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n\n## Installation and Usage:\n\nNoChatReports supports both Fabric and Forge, just download the version for your respective modloader and game version. It can be installed on either the client, server, or on both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present on:\n\n**1. Only Client:** The client will refuse to send the account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof that they were actually sent from your account. The server will relay them unless the `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to `true` in the `server.properties` file (which it is by default since 1.19.1)\n\nIf the server does require you to sign messages and you are on either 1.19.1 or 1.19.2, you will not be able to join the server unless you agree to send signed messages (NoChatReports will supply a warning screen), if you are on 1.19.3 or higher, you will still be able to join the server, but will not be able to use chat-related commands (other commands do still work)\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but the server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable the conversion of player to system messages in the config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\nAs of 1.20.2 the server cannot disable the \"unsigned messages\" warning on the client. It can only be disabled if the client has NoChatReports (or a similar mod) installed.\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signatures will be stripped on the client side before sending messages to the server, which will not attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough NoChatReports can function when it is only present on one of either sides, NoChatReports can be configured to demand itself to be installed on the respective other side in order to play. This way you can install it on the server and require all clients that join to have NoChatReports installed, but you can also leave it server-only if you prefer.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on the client, NoChatReports will disable Telemetry (similar to what [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make sure that your server is compatible with NoChatReports, you can take a look at [this part of the wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players).\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe configuration files are located in the `NoChatReports` subfolder of the default config folder.\n\n`NCR-Client.json` stores Client-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Common.json` stores Server-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Encryption.json` stores Chat Encryption settings (Only effective on the client)\n\n`NCR-ServerPreferences.json` stores Per-Server Signing Modes\n\nYou can find more information [here](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/).\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to Chat Encryption, watching it will help you to learn how it is used (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features the following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make clients with No Chat Reports installed recognize servers running your software as safe. I wrote [a small article](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status) about this. For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH_q7ZuCJs0\n\n<a href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/AIZISTRAL\" target=\"_blank\">![image](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/af63cb17-c373-4c82-aa1d-29beb7b045a9.png)</a>\n",

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n### Credits\n\nIn certain older versions, this library used to bundle typetools; you can find its license [here](https://github.com/jhalterman/typetools/blob/master/LICENSE.txt \"\")",

It should generate `kubejs` folder in your minecraft directory with example scripts. startup scripts only get run once when the game loads. Those are for registering items, setting up configs etc. Server/data scripts are loaded when you join a world, those are better for things like clearlag, displaying custom login messages and world/player related things in general.\n\n## Can I reload scripts?\nYes, use `/reload`. Note: Not everything is reloadable. Some things require you to restart game, some only world, some work on fly.\n\n## I don't know JavaScript / I need help with this mod\nThere's examples and pre-made scripts on [KubeJS Wiki](https://kubejs.com/).\n\n## How does this mod work?\nIt uses [Rhino](https://modrinth.com/mod/rhino), a JavaScript engine originally by Mozilla.\n\n## Ok, but what if it.. doesn't work?\nYou can report issues on [Here](https://kubejs.com/support?source=kubejs).\n\n## I have more questions/suggestions!\nIf wiki didn't have the answer for what you were looking for, you can join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/lat) and ask for help in one of the `#support` channels!\n\n[![](https://kubejs.com/discord.png)](https://discord.gg/lat)",

With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.</p>\n<p>Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you though all added mechanics and gadgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: In order to be able to see all recipes required in Create, consider installing <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\">JEI</a>. The vanilla recipe book will not be able to guide you through the experience by itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/issues\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qPmjSXy.png\" width=\"160\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrKV2QTuyGcv4E3eSJpBiYA/playlists\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/L1bU9mr.png\" width=\"160\" /></a><a href=\"https://discord.gg/hmaD7Se\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uf6V9ZX.png\" width=\"160\" /></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/Supporting-the-Project\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fHQ45KR.png\" width=\"227\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Development\n\n<p>Find out about supported versions and what's currently in the works in <a href=\"https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/dev.status\">this dedicated wiki page.</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Developers\n\n<p>simibubi, Jozufozu, Pepper, Zelophed, gamez7, Grimmauld, Snownee</p>\n\n### Artists\n\n<p>Kryppers, voxel_dani, LeastReality, vectorwing</p>\n\n### Contributors\n\n<p>tterrag, evanthebruce, D'Arcy Olla, Kayla</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Localization\nLocalizations are kindly submitted from our community on CrowdIn.

          "body": "[Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create) integration for [KubeJS](https://modrinth.com/mod/kubejs). This mod allows you to add and properly edit recipes of Create mod in KubeJS scripts. All supported recipe types and examples are below. See [Recipes page](https://mods.latvian.dev/books/kubejs/page/recipeeventjs) for more info.\n\nSupported recipe types:\n\n- `createCrushing`\n- `createCutting`\n- `createMilling`\n- `createBasin`\n- `createMixing` (supports **.heated()** and **.superheated()**)\n- `createCompacting` (supports **.heated()** and **.superheated()**)\n- `createPressing`\n- `createSandpaperPolishing`\n- `createSplashing` (Bulk Washing)\n- `createDeploying`\n- `createFilling`\n- `createEmptying`\n\n> Note: Bulk Smoking = vanilla smoking and Bulk Blasting = vanilla blasting recipe types.\n\n`event.recipes.createCrushing(output[], input[])`\nOutput doesn't have to be an array. It can be either items or fluids\nInput doesn't have to be an array. It can be either ingredients or `Fluid.of('minecraft:water', 1000)` or `{fluidTag: 'some:fluid_tag', amount: 1000}`\n\n### `createMechanicalCrafting`\n\n`event.recipes.createMechanicalCrafting(output, pattern[], {patternKey: input})`\n\nThis recipe type is the same as regular crafting table shaped recipe\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createSequencedAssembly(output[], input, sequence[]) \n// output[] are your output items\n// input is your input item\n// sequence[] is an array of sequences. These sequences are \"regular\" recipes that are supported.\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createCrushing([\n  '2x minecraft:cobblestone',\n  'minecraft:redstone',\n  Item.of('minecraft:redstone').withChance(0.5)\n], 'minecraft:redstone_ore')\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createMixing('create:chromatic_compound', [\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:polished_rose_quartz'\n]).superheated()\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createFilling('create:blaze_cake', [\n  'create:blaze_cake_base',\n  Fluid.of('minecraft:lava', 250)\n])\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createEmptying([\n  'minecraft:glass_bottle',\n  Fluid.of('create:honey', 250)\n], 'minecraft:honey_bottle')\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createMechanicalCrafting('minecraft:piston', [\n  'CCCCC',\n  'CPIPC',\n  'CPRPC'\n], {\n  C: '#forge:cobblestone',\n  P: '#minecraft:planks',\n  R: '#forge:dusts/redstone',\n  I: '#forge:ingots/iron'\n})\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createSequencedAssembly([ // start the recipe\n Item.of('6x create:large_cogwheel').withChance(32.0), // have this item be an output with a certain chance\n Item.of('create:brass_ingot').withChance(2.0), // have this item be an output with a certain chance\n 'minecraft:andesite', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'create:cogwheel', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'minecraft:stick', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'minecraft:iron_nugget' // have this item be a guaranteed output\n], 'create:brass_ingot', [ // 'create:brass_ingot' is the input.\n// the transitional item set by \"transitionalItem('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel')\" is the item that will be used during the recipe as the item that the input is using to transition to the output.\n event.recipes.createDeploying('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', ['create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', '#minecraft:planks']), // like a normal recipe function, is used as a sequence step in this array. Input and output have the transitional item\n event.recipes.createDeploying('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', ['create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', '#minecraft:wooden_buttons']), // like a normal recipe function, is used as a sequence step in this array. Input and output have the transitional item\n event.recipes.createCutting('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', 'create:incomplete_large_cogwheel').processingTime(50) // like a normal recipe function, is used as a sequence step in this array. Input and output have the transitional item\n]).transitionalItem('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel').loops(6) // set the transitional item and the loops (amount of repetitions)\n```\n\nIf you want to use your own transitional item in sequenced_assembly recipes, you must register it in startup event:\n\n```javascript\nonEvent('item.registry', event => {\n  // Texture for this item goes in kubejs/assets/kubejs/textures/item/my_part.png\n  event.create('my_part', 'create:sequenced_assembly').displayName('My Part')\n})\n```\n\nThen you would use ...`transitionalItem('kubejs:my_part')`...\n\n> Note! Mysterious Conversion recipes are client side only, so the only way to add them currently is using reflection with this code in client scripts (outside any event):\n\n```javascript\nlet MysteriousItemConversionCategory = java('com.simibubi.create.compat.jei.category.MysteriousItemConversionCategory')\nlet ConversionRecipe = java('com.simibubi.create.compat.jei.ConversionRecipe')\n\nMysteriousItemConversionCategory.RECIPES.add(ConversionRecipe.create('minecraft:apple', 'minecraft:carrot'))\nMysteriousItemConversionCategory.RECIPES.add(ConversionRecipe.create('minecraft:golden_apple', 'minecraft:golden_carrot'))\n```\n\n[![](https://kubejs.com/discord.png)](https://discord.gg/lat)",

Works by shading the Kotlin libraries, providing KotlinLanguageProvider to load @Mod object declarations, providing AutoKotlinEventBusSubscriber to load @EventBusSubscriber declarations, and providing useful utility functions and constants.\n\nAs of Kotlin for Forge 1.8.0, this provides [Kotlin 1.4.21](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin), [Kotlin coroutines 1.4.2](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines), [Kotlin JSON serialization 1.0.1](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization), and [Jetbrains annotations 20.1.0](https://github.com/JetBrains/java-annotations).\n\n \n\n**If you're not a mod developer, this is a dependency mod.**\n      \n \n\nUnlike Kottle, this library (as of 1.2.0) provides its own implementation of IEventBus that supports IEventBus#addListener and IEventBus#addGenericListener with function references.\n\n \n\nInformation for how to implement can be found [here](https://github.com/thedarkcolour/KotlinForForge/blob/master/README.md).\nYou do not have to use the language loader or any of the features Kotlin for Forge provides, you can just use it for the bundled Kotlin libraries.\n\n \n\nIf you'd like to ask for help or suggest something, feel free to do so on the [Kotlin for Forge discord server](https://discord.gg/tmVmZtx).",

          "body": "Features of this library are:\n\n- Dynamic resource pack utilities\nA set of utilities that allow creating dynamic runtime resource packs and datapacks. Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily. Fluids are virtual so they can only exist in modded container specifically for them\n \n\n-Dispenser utilities:\nSome code that allows to easily register dispenser behaviors without overriding already existing ones. Also comes with builtin spawn egg and block placement behaviors\n\n ",

          "body": "# Discontinued as of 1.21\n\nThis project will not be officially ported for 1.21 and above. For reasons and further details, please check the [thread](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/issues/427) on GitHub. Current versions for 1.20.6 and below will still receive updates and support for the foreseeable future.\n\nFor alternative accessory APIs and unofficial continuations available for 1.21, please see:\n\n- [Accessories (alternative API with a Curios compatibility layer)](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories)\n- [Curios API Continuation (Curios-based API)](https://modrinth.com/mod/curios-continuation)\n\n# Overview\n\nCurios is a flexible and expandable accessory/equipment API for users and developers. The purpose is to provide functionality for developers to add extra accessory/equipment slots in a convenient and compatible manner, as well as to give users the ability to configure these slots to their preferences. By default, Curios does not add any content except for an inventory GUI. There are no slots and only two items, the latter only being available through the Creative menu and primarily serving as examples for developers to use when coding their own integration.\n\n## Features\n* **Expandable equipment slots through a central library.** New equipment slots can be made and managed easily through an identifier registry. Identical identifiers will be merged together to avoid functional redundancies and provide maximum compatibility to potential items, while unique identifiers can still be used to mark special types when appropriate.\n* **Slots are only made on-demand.** There are no slots included by default, all slots are created only as needed. This reduces instances where one or more superfluous slots are present without any suitable items to go into the slot.\n* **Slots are completely customizable and manipulable.** Slots can have custom backgrounds, different sizes, and can even be disabled or hidden by default. But how would a player even access disabled slots? Through the API, developers can access functions to enable/disable a player's slots or add/remove a certain number of slots of a given type.\n* **Flexible item->curio relations using the vanilla tag system.** Potential curios are selected through the vanilla tag system, which means that categorizing items into curio types is as easy as creating a .json file in the data/curios/tags folder. Items can be categorized into as many curio types as you want as long as they're tagged in the appropriate files, and these settings can even be overridden entirely. For more information, see the vanilla tag system.\n* **Complete integration with other inventory mechanics.** Mending and Curses will work with all applicable items equipped in the curio slots. There are also various minor features for developers that make it simpler to integrate their current items or mechanics into the curio system.\n* **Accessible from a single GUI.** Curios comes with its own GUI accessible from the inventory that shows all of the available slots to a player. This allows players to see all of the extended equipment slots in a central location without needing to access different inventory GUIs. However, developers can still provide their own GUIs for their mod-specific slots if they want. The default keybinding for the GUI is 'g'.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/NNByxcQ/curiogui.png)\n\n## Documentation\n* [Setting Up the Development Environment](https://docs.illusivesoulworks.com/curios/getting-started)\n* [Slots](https://docs.illusivesoulworks.com/category/slots)\n* [Example Datapack](https://docs.illusivesoulworks.com/curios/slots/datapack-example)\n* [Slots Configuration](https://docs.illusivesoulworks.com/curios/configuration)\n* [Commands](https://docs.illusivesoulworks.com/curios/commands)\n* [Legacy Documentation for 1.19.x and Below](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki)",

Storage Drawers borrows ideas from Jabba and Bibliocraft, resulting in a highly functional, compact, and aesthetic storage solution that is meant to complement rather than replace those mods.\n\nUsage\n\nThere is no traditional slotted inventory with these containers. Interaction is click-based similar to Jabba. Clicking on one of drawers on front will interact with that drawer.\n\n* Right-Click: Insert full stack in hand into drawer (or partial stack if the drawer fills).\n* Double-Right-Click: Insert all compatible stacks in inventory into drawer (or until drawer fills).\n* Left-Click: Remove a single item from the drawer.\n* Shift+Left-Click: Remove a full stack from the drawer.\n* Shift+Right-Click with empty hand: Open a UI to see exact item counts and manage applied upgrades.\n\nThe shift-click behavior is reversed from Jabba. This is based on the theory that you normally interact with stacks in Jabba, but will want to normally interact with single items in Storage Drawers. The controls can be reversed in the mod config to match Jabba.",

          "body": "## Enhanced Block Entities\n\nEBE is a **100% client side** Minecraft mod for the **[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/)** mod loader which aims to increase the performance of block entity rendering, as well as offer customizability via resource packs. <br/><br/>\n**How does it work?** EBE Makes some block entities use baked block models rather than laggy entity models. <br/><br/>\n**Is it just an optimization mod?** EBE isn't *just* an optimization mod, some side effects of its optimizations are many visual improvements. <br/>\nThese may include:\n- Smooth lighting on block entities\n- Being able to remodel block entities with block models\n- Toggling features like christmas chests\n- Being able to see block entities from as far away as possible\n<br/><br/>\n\n**What about animations?** The best part about EBE is that you still get to keep animations, while gaining the performance boost of baked models! Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>\n\n### [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) is required to use EBE with [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium). <br/><br/> \n**Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)**\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## FAQ and Help\n\n**Q: I need help with the mod/need to report a bug!** <br/>\n**A:** If you're having trouble setting up the mod or using it alongside other mods, I'd recommend you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9) and ask for help there. *If the issue is a BUG* please report it on our issue tracker (\"Issues\" tab at the top of the page)<br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests have glitched animations!** <br/>\n**A:** You're likely using Sodium, which doesn't support certain Fabric Rendering features by default. If you need to use Sodium with EBE, you should install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests are invisible!** <br/>\n**A:** You may be using a resource pack that conflicts with EBE. Open the Block Entity Settings menu (through EBE's Mod Menu entry or through vanilla Video Settings) and enable \"Force Resource Pack Compatibility\". <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: How is this different from [FastChest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastchest)?** <br/>\n**A:** FastChest does not preserve chest animations, and only optimizes chests (in a similar way to EBE). EBE also optimizes other block entities:\n- Ender Chests\n- Signs\n- Bells\n- Beds\n- Shulker Boxes\n- Decorated Pots\n<br/><br/>\n\n## FPS Boost\nRendering 1700 chests:\n### Vanilla\n![Before](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/before.png)\n### With EBE\n![After](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/after.png) <br/>\nA 155% frame rate increase!\n\n## Resource Packs\nHere's an example of how you can customize chests with resource packs using EBE. <br/><br/>\n![Custom Chest GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55095883/112942134-f67fe780-912f-11eb-8b11-cf316544c22b.gif)",

          "body": "# EntityCulling\n\nUsing async path-tracing to skip rendering Block/Entities that are not visible. [Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com//partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.",

In ModMenu these are accordingly labelled.\n\n### How does this mod work?\n\n**At it's core, this mod is quite simple:**\n\nNormally, when quitting a singleplayer world, the client will wait until the server thread has finished saving the world before going to the Title Screen.\nThis mod skips this waiting period and lets the server continue saving in the background.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** this does not always make quitting a world instant, as the client can still take a bit of time to unload rendered chunks etc. However, even in that case you will see a speedup as clientside unloading and serverside saving now perform simultaneously instead of one after the other.\n\n**Of course in practice this is not quite that easy:**\n\nWhen working with multiple threads like this, many problems arise.\nFor example, when going to the world list, Minecraft will try to read its level data but fails because the background saving still locks the world file.\n\nInstead, we now access the information through the still saving server.\nSimilarly, when trying to edit, delete or recreate the world, we have to use the existing session.\n\nTo keep these processes thread safe, a lot of synchronization has to be done to ensure the saving server and the client don't get in each other's way.\n\nFor some things, like rejoining the still saving world or making a backup, we just wait for the server to finish saving completely.\nWe also wait for the worlds to finish saving when quitting the game to ensure no data is lost.\n\n### Thanks to...\n\n#### Translators:\n- Felix14-v2 (Russian)\n- Cccc-owo (Simplified Chinese)\n- JustAlittleWolf (German)\n- YakisikliBaran (Turkish)\n- Skidamek (Polish)\n- Oondanomala (Italian)\n- Madis0 (Estonian)\n- notlin4 (Traditional Chinese)\n- BurrConnie (Ukrainian)\n- GodGun968 (Simplified Chinese)\n- ImVietnam (Vietnamese)\n- ishi-sama (French)\n- KAGUYA-1137 (Japanese)\n####\n\n### Compatibility\n\nWith the help of [MixinExtras](https://github.com/LlamaLad7/MixinExtras) and a custom Mixin Config Plugin, the mixins have been designed to be very non-intrusive while also being very effective.\n\nBecause of that there is currently no known incompatibilities.\n\nIf you do suspect an incompatibility with another mod, please [open an issue](#problems)!\n\n### Problems?\n\nIf you are experiencing any problems, please open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/KingContaria/FastQuit/issues)!\n\nMake sure to attach important info like other mods you were using, log- or crash-files and if possible steps to reproduce.\n\nBefore uploading any files make sure to get rid of personal data!

For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.",

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 400 chests on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 170 FPS                 | 205 FPS              | 1.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 315 FPS                 | 410 FPS              | 1.30x       |\n\n## Compatibility\nImmediatelyFast is structured to interfere with mods as little as possible.\nIt should work fine with most if not all mods and modpacks.\n\nKnown incompatibilities:\n\n- OptiFabric / OptiFine\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/issues).\n\n## Developer API\nYou can read the latest version of the API docs [here](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/blob/1.20/API_DOCS.md).\n\n## Partners\nYourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools\nfor monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.\nYourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/),\n[YourKit .NET Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/),\nand [YourKit YouMonitor](https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor/).\n\n[![YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png)](https://www.yourkit.com)\n\n---\n\nKinetic Hosting offers extremely affordable deals on servers with very good hardware!

CPUs with 8 or less threads), you may have noticed that Minecraft takes up 100% of the CPU when loading into the title screen, causing cursor stutter and makes multitasking painfully difficult. Smooth Boot (Reloaded) solves this problem completely, and loading should be much smoother and potentially faster as well.\n\n### Features\n\nChange amount of threads used for loading\nChange priority of threads used by Minecraft\n\n### How the mod works\n\nMinecraft uses executors to run multithreaded tasks. The problem is that the tasks that are ran during loading are quite heavy on the CPU, so it leads to 100% CPU usage. And, some of the tasks do not necessarily benefit from multithreading. Smooth Boot fixes these problems by change the parameters of the executors, including the number of threads they use and the priority of each thread.\n\nFor more information, please read the [Smooth Boot (Reloaded) wiki](https://github.com/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded/wiki).\n\n### Modpack Permissions\n\nSmooth Boot (Reloaded) is a free and open-source project on Modrinth, and as such-- of course you can include it in your modpack!\n\n### Issues and Feature Requests\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the bottom of the page to report bugs, crashes, and if you want to propose new features or otherwise contribute to the mod, i will gladly accept pull requests, as well!\n\nIf you want to support me, use my code **AbdElAziz333** to get 25% off your first month and enjoy playing with your friends!\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.imgur.com/ytD8AVA.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/AbdElAziz333)\n\n**Thanks!**",

          "body": "Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n",

          "body": "Petrol's Parts is a collection of components for transferring rotational force in Create. There are no retextured Cogwheels or \"blackboxes\" - every component provides a new connection not available in base Create, and all are satisfyingly animated.\n\nThe kinetic components were ported from [Destroy](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-destroy) into this separate mod so you don't have to deal with the parts of Destroy I actually spent time on.\n\nPetrol's Parts (note: the mod is not called \"Create: Petrol's Parts\") adds the following components:\n- **Coaxial Cogwheel** and **Large Coaxial Cogwheel** - Cogwheels whose Shafts and teeth rotate independently\n- **Differential** - rotates at the sum of its two input speeds\n- **Double Cardan Shaft** - Shafts that go around a corner\n- **Planetary Gearset** - modified Large Cogwheel\n- **Colossal Cogwheel** - a 5x5 ring gear\n\nAll have Ponders explaining them. None of them too easily allow you to make connections that are difficult in base Create, but they do still disrupt the 'intended' core Create gameplay of rotation-force-connection-puzzles, so modpack authors may wish to gate the recipes for Petrol's Parts components.\n\n**It requires [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) and [this library](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/petrolpark)!**",

Players can bookmark worlds by clicking on the star next to the world icon.\n\nBookmarking worlds will force them to always show up at the top of the world selection list and removes the ability to delete them until they are unmarked. Players can bookmark as many worlds as they want. If there are multiple bookmarked worlds, they will internally be ordered by last played date.\n\n**This mod is client-side only.**\n\n## Features\n\n### Single Player Worlds\n\n![World Select Screen with Favorites](https://i.ibb.co/23MxVBp/selectworld.png)\n\n### Multiplayer Worlds\n\n![Multiplayer Select Screen with Favorites](https://i.ibb.co/C6Qjwp9/selectserver.png)\n\n## Support\n\nPlease report all bugs, issues, and feature requests to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/CherishedWorlds/issues).\n\nFor non-technical support and questions, join the developer's [Discord](https://discord.gg/JWgrdwt).\n\n## License\n\nAll source code and assets are licensed under LGPL 3.0.\n\n## Donations\n\nDonations to the developer can be sent through [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/C0C1NL4O).\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/5Tw6mh2/bisect-illusive.webp)](https://illusivesoulworks.com/affiliate)\n",

It's possible to set items to any specific slot in the inventory, to the offhand and to the armour slots. The mod can detect which players have never joined before. If another mod adds items, such as guide books, they can either be removed completely or added after the kit has been set. This is configurable via the <em>addExistingItemsAfterKitSet</em> config option.<br><br>Can be used in a server for all new players or in singleplayer to start off with a default inventory of your choosing. There is also optional support for FTB's Team Island mod after the create island command.<br><br>The mod can be used <strong>server-side only</strong>. If you want players to be able to use the \"Choose Kit GUI\", it has to be installed on the client as well. Alternatively, they can choose kits via server commands.<br><br><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Features:</strong></span><br>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; A guide here in the description. Difficulty ranging from <strong>Simple</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong>.<br>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Give players joining the world for the first time custom starter items and/or potion effects.<br>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Support for multiple kits. Can be given randomly or chosen by the player.<br>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; There is custom tracking to determine who are new players, compatible with existing worlds.<br>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Lots of commands! For creating, adding, managing and choosing starter kits.<br>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; If installed on the client, kits can be chosen via a custom GUI screen. If not, commands can be used.<br>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Add descriptions to your kits. RPG modpack, anyone?<br>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Remove other modded starter items, such as guide books. Or add them after the starter kit.<br><br></span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px\">Configurable:</span> <span style=\"color:#008000;font-size:14px\"><a style=\"color:#008000\" href=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.information/wiki/how-to-configure-mods\" rel=\"nofollow\">(&nbsp;how do I configure?&nbsp;)</a></span><br></strong><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>randomizeMultipleKitsToggle</strong> (default = true): When multiple starter kits are added via /starterkit add, there are two ways to distribute them.

When disabled, players can choose one on first join.<br><strong>addExistingItemsAfterKitSet</strong> (default = true): Whether items that existed in the inventory, such as books added by other mods, should be added back to the inventory after the kit was set. If disabled, they'll be removed. You can still manually set them via the kit.<br><strong>usePotionEffectsInStarterKit</strong> (default = true): If potion/mob effect functionality should be enabled. This means that when creating a kit via /sk (add/set), it also saves the active effects the player has. And when handing out the starter kits, it adds the effects to new players.<br><strong>formatKitNames</strong> (default = true): If kit names should be formatted. Each word will be capitalized.<br><br><strong>chooseKitScreenHeader</strong> (default = \"%s, you can choose a starter kit!\"): The text used above the kit choice screen, or if the mod is not installed in the chat. %s will be replaced with the player's name.<br><br><strong>announcePlayerKitChoiceInDedicatedServer</strong> (default = true): Whether an announcement should be broadcasted to the server whenever a new player makes a kit choice. 'randomizeMultipleKitsToggle' must be disabled, and there must be at least 2 starter kits available.<br><strong>enableFTBIslandCreateCompatibility</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): Whether the starter kit should be re-set after the '/ftbteamislands create' command from FTB Team Islands. Does nothing when it's not installed.<br></span></p>\r\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Commands:</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><em><br>Both '/starterkit' and '/sk' can be used.</em><strong><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Admin Commands:</span></strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">/sk add (kit_name)</span> - <em>Adds your current inventory to the active kits.</em><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">/sk set (kit_name)</span> - <em>Sets your current inventory as the only active kit.</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">/sk give &lt;player&gt; (kit_name)</span> - <em>Give a player a random (or specific) starter kit.</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">/sk activate &lt;kit_name&gt;/_all</span> - <em>Moves kit_name or all kits from inactive to active.</em><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">/sk deactivate &lt;kit_name&gt;/_all</span> - <em>Moves kit_name or all kits from active to inactive.</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">/sk list (inactive)</span> - <em>Lists all active (or inactive) kits.</em><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">/sk reset</span> - <em>Resets all tracking.

To keep a better overview, I've divided the difficulty into three different sections. <strong>Simple</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong>.<br></span><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Simple:</strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Set a custom starter kit. Add/Remove starter items from other mods. And giving players a starter kit via commands.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Intermediate:</strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Add an extra starter kit. Deactivate a kit via commands. Add a starter kit with potion effects, and setting the level and duration.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Advanced:</strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Make players choose a kit on first join. Move the inactive default kits to active. Show the choose kit GUI screen. Create a starter kit with a custom description.</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-size:36px\"><strong>Section 1: <span style=\"font-size:36px\">Simple</span></strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">This is the default starter kit, which will be given when the mod is installed without any configuration:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/0.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can set your own starter kit by using the '<em><strong>/starterkit set (kit_name)</strong></em>' (or '<em><strong>/sk set (kit_name)</strong></em>') command. The kit name is optional.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">After using this command, all other active starter kits are moved to the inactive folder.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/1.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Here you can see the new starter kit data file that was created with the previous command. It's located in '<em><strong>./config/starterkit/kits/</strong></em>':</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/2.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">That's it! All new players will now receive the \"<strong>Upgraded</strong>\" kit when they first join the world:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/3.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Inside the config file, located at '<em><strong>./config/starterkit.json5</strong></em>', you can choose whether or not other modded starter items should be removed or given after the kit.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Examples of these modded starter items are guide books.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/4.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">To give other players (or yourself) a starter kit manually, you can use the '<em><strong>/starterkit give &lt;player&gt; (kit_name)</strong></em>' command.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The kit_name argument is optional, if left out:</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If the mod is configured via intermediate, a kit may be given randomly.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If the mod is configured via advanced, the kit choice screen may be shown.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/5.png\"><br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-size:36px\"><strong>Section 2: <span style=\"font-size:36px\">Intermediate</span></strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can add another active kit by using the '<em><strong>/starterkit add (kit_name)</strong></em>' command.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">With the default configuration, this means that new players will now randomly receive the \"<strong>Default</strong>\" or \"<strong>No Bread</strong>\" starter kit.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/6.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">To see all active starter kits, use the '<em><strong>/starterkit list</strong></em>' command. To see inactive starter kits, use '<em><strong>/starterkit list inactive</strong></em>':</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/7.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">To disable an active kit, use '<em><strong>/starterkit deactivate &lt;kit_name&gt;</strong></em>'. This moves it to the '<em><strong>./config/starterkit/kits/inactive/</strong></em>' folder.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/8.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The mod can also give potion effects alongside the starter kit! Make sure '<strong>usePotionEffectsInStarterKit</strong>' is enabled in the config.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Then, just make sure to have the potion effect enabled, and use the '<em><strong>/starterkit set</strong></em>' or '<em><strong>/starterkit add</strong></em>' command.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The effect duration will be set to what the player has exactly now, but we will round that up in a later step.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/9.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">For this example, I've given the player the speed potion effect. This was active when using the previous command:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/10.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Locate and open the kit we've just created. The path is '<em><strong>./config/starterkit/kits/Speed_Kit.txt</strong></em>':</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/11_1.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">This is the data file for the \"<strong>Speed Kit</strong>\" kit. It contains the items the player will receive and at the bottom what effects will be given to the player.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">When a kit is created without active effects, that line will be empty. Otherwise it copies the exact level and duration.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">In case of this example, it contains a reference to the Speed effect. It's <strong>lvl 1</strong> with a duration of <strong>3341 ticks</strong>, which equals 167 seconds. <strong>20 ticks = 1 second</strong>.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/11_2.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">I'm going to change the effect a player will receive to <strong>Speed level 5</strong>, with a duration of <strong>5 minutes</strong>. 6000 ticks = 300 seconds = 5 minutes:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/12.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can reload any changes you've made to files inside '<em><strong>./config/starterkit/</strong></em>' via the '<em><strong>/starterkit reload</strong></em>' command:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/13.png\"><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><br>That's it! Whenever a player first joins a world, they will now receive the \"<strong>Speed Kit</strong>\" kit. Which contains a few standard items and the <strong>Speed V</strong> effect, with a duration of <strong>5 minutes</strong>:</span></p>\r\n<details><summary>Show Spoiler</summary>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/14.gif\"></p>\r\n</details>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br><br><br><span style=\"font-size:36px\"><strong>Section 3: <span style=\"font-size:36px\">Advanced</span></strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Starter Kit also contains a custom kit choosing screen! Here's an example of what it looks like with the \"<strong>Default</strong>\" kit.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">In this section we'll enable this, create a kit and add a description for it.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/15_1.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Disable the \"<em><strong>Randomize Multiple Kits Toggle</strong></em>\" inside the config. Remember, it's located inside '<em><strong>./config/starterkit.json5</strong></em>'. You can also use the in-game config editor for this:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/15_2.png\" width=\"1143\" height=\"664\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">There are some default kits located inside the '<em><strong>./config/starterkit/kits/inactive/</strong></em>' folder.

Perhaps if you've not used many resource packs you may not have noticed, but the hotbar has been broken for a long time in Java Edition (<a href=\"https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-67532\">MC-67532</a>). Not only is the selector texture cut off by a couple pixels, but the entire hotbar was actually designed for being raised up off of the bottom of the screen. Restore how it was meant to be and raise it up!</p>\n<p>Please note that, for Minecraft 1.20.2 and up, the hotbar selector has seen further alterations that require attention. Raised now allows you to fix it by several methods or not at all if you so wish! See the wiki for more information.</p>\n<p>4.x brings big changes to Raised! This update adds support to move the bossbar, scoreboard sidebar, effects icons, players list, and toasts, in addition to the existing support to move the hotbar, chat, and other mod elements! You can move these elements on both the x-axis and y-axis from any cardinal or ordinal direction. Either use the GUI or commands to control the configurable options.

Do not report issues encountered with it to their bug tracker or in their\nDiscord. You can report issues on the [Xenon GitHub](https://github.com/anthxnymc/xenon) or on my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/c6BBguCUWx).\n\n## Compatibility\n\n**OptiFine is not supported**. This mod replaces OptiFine.\n\nXenon will work with everything Embeddium does, as it is a fork. We intend to keep compatibility\nwith upstream and Embeddium / Forge Sodium addons as much as possible.\n\n## Shaders\n\nFor now, please continue to use [Oculus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oculus) if you want shader support.\nIf you encounter issues with shaders installed, disable Oculus first, and if that fixes it, report the issue to them instead. \n\n## Credits\n\n* JellySquid & the CaffeineMC team, for making Sodium in the first place, without which this project would not be possible\n* Asek3, for the initial port to Forge\n* embeddedt for their work on Embeddium, from which this mod is forked\n* FlashyReese & TexTrue for the vertical video options mod, and its Forge port, respectively.\n* SrRapero720 for bug fixes and contributions to Embeddium Extras.\n* XFactHD, for providing a list of gamebreaking Rubidium issues to start this work off, and for testing early builds\n* Pepper, for their invaluable assistance with getting Forge lighting to work on Sodium 0.5\n\n## License\n\nXenon currently follows the license of upstream Sodium (LGPL-3.0).\n\n[Our Discord](https://discord.gg/kyBCuYUzFB)",
